# Design_and_Analysis_of_Algorithms
**Course Objectives:**

1) **Understanding Key Concepts:** Gain a solid foundation in the essential definitions, concepts, and terminology related to algorithms and data structures. This includes learning about what algorithms are, how data structures organize data, and how to analyze the performance of these algorithms.

2) **Algorithm Design Techniques:** Explore the different methods and strategies used to design algorithms. This includes learning about common approaches like divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and others, and understanding when and why to use each technique.

3) **Performance Analysis:** Learn how to assess the efficiency of an algorithm using formal analysis techniques. You will evaluate an algorithm's time complexity (how fast it runs) and space complexity (how much memory it uses) using Big-O notation and other measures of performance.

4) **Comparing Solutions:** Develop the ability to analyze and compare different algorithms that solve the same problem. This includes evaluating their efficiency, ensuring their correctness, and determining which one is most suitable for specific tasks or scenarios based on the problemâ€™s constraints or requirements.
